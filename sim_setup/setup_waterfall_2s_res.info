4; runtype (0: yang, 1: yang parallel, 4: two stage waterfall resistor, 6: three stage waterfall resistor)
0; allow optimization (checks if the wire has cooled to within T_sub_eps, then stops calculation of thermal model)
1; simulate transmission (if 1, treats transmission line as a pure delay, fast, but not very accurate. If 2, calculates a non-feedback (no reflections) transmission line response with NTL segments. If 3, similar to 2, but with explicit matrices, so faster, but original circuit is represented less physically accurate. If 4, also explicit, but without a dummy resistor to represent the original circuit)
